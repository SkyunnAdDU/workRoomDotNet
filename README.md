## Getting Started

# Student Attendance Scanner Using QR Code for Work Room Access  

## Project Overview  
This project aims to develop a QR code-based student attendance scanner system that records the attendance of students when they use the workroom facilities. The system will utilize the students' existing ID cards, which contain QR codes or barcodes encoded with their name and course. By scanning the QR codes or barcodes, the system ensures accurate and automated attendance tracking.  

## Objectives  
- **Attendance Logging**: Replace manual attendance logging with an automated system that scans student ID QR codes.  
- **Data Summary**: Provide detailed summaries, including:  
  - Number of visitors  
  - Number of repeated visits  
  - Number of unique visits  
- **Reporting Function**: Enable reporting for misbehaving students and defective equipment.  

## Scope  
- **QR Code Integration**: Utilize existing QR codes on student IDs containing encoded information such as name, course, and ID photo.  
- **User Interface**: Develop a simple and intuitive interface for administrators to manage records and generate reports.  
- **Physical Setup**: Include a QR scanner connected to a computer. System usage will be encouraged but not mandatory.
